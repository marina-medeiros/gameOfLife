 * @description
 * This program simulates the Conway's Game of Life.
 * It reads a initial game configuration from a input file and
 * keeps updating it, if the user so whishes.

 * @remark On 2015-09-19 changed the way stability is verified.
 * In the previous version we just looked back one configuration and compare it
 * with the current configuration.
 * Now, the stability may span more than one configuration. Because of that we
 * need to keep track of all configurations and check whether the current
 * configuration has already been generated.
 * If this is the case, the game has reached stability and must stop.
